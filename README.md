#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that involves the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. 

**Importance of software engineering in the technology industry.**

**scalability**
The systems are able to handle increasing workloads and data volume without necessarily reducing their performance.
**Flexibility**
This allows software systems to adapt to the changing requirements,market demands and new technology 
**Security-** With the increasing cyber threats softwares require security to protect them from such vulnerabilities
**Problem solving**
Software Engineering helps to identify,analyze and find effective solutions to challenges faced in the technology industry.
**Usability and accessibility**
It helps to create a good user experience by making the system easy to use and accessible to people.
**Innvovation**
Creating new and improved solutions to challenges in the technology industry.


**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

formalizing software engineering
a period where software projects were failing due to complexity, inefficiency, and lack of structured development methods. This milestone emphasized the need for systematic approaches, leading to the development of formal engineering practices in software development.
adopting structured programming
The introduction of programming paradigms like structured programming (popularized by Edsger Dijkstra) helped improve code readability and maintainability by emphasizing control structures such as loops and conditionals instead of using goto statements.
shifting to Agile methodologies
the Agile Manifesto introduced a flexible, iterative approach that prioritized customer collaboration, adaptability, and continuous delivery over strict planning and documentation. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban have since dominated modern software development, enabling faster and more efficient project execution.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
**

Planning - In this stage a project plan is established,its scope,goals,timeline,resouces and extimated costs are defined.
Requirements gathering- Gathering maximum information from the client requirements.
Design - Involves scrutinizing whether the prepared software meets all the requirements of the end user and stakeholders review and make suggestions
coding and implementation - Transalting the design into computer-readable language.
Testing - Testing the functionality of the entire system in the environment
deployement - releasing it for customers for use
maintainance - Taking care of the developed product

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be approp**riate.

Waterfall methodology is where each preceeding step in the Software Development Life Cycle is completed before moving to the next while Agile methodology breaks down the Software Development Life Cycle into cycles that deliver small changes to the software.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

A software developer is responsible for designing,coding,testing and maintaining software applications by analyzing user eeds and creating code to fulfill those needs.
A quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the products and servics meet quality standards.
A project manager plans ,executes and manages a project and ensures the project is done within the designated timeline.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors


**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**

rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**

Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**

prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**

Vague prompt : Draw a picture of a car 
Improved 
Draw a realistic digital painting of a luxury sports car parked on an open road at sunset. The car is sleek, aerodynamic, and painted in glossy black with chrome accents. The background features a scenic view with mountains and a glowing orange sky. The lighting reflects beautifully on the car’s surface, highlighting its curves and design."

Clarity – It avoids vague language and directly states what is required. Instead of saying “a nice car,” it specifies “a luxury sports car.”
Conciseness – It provides essential details without unnecessary words, ensuring the model focuses on the most relevant aspects.
Specificity – It includes key attributes such as "glossy black," "chrome accents," "open road," "sunset," and "mountains," which guide the AI to generate a more accurate image.
By refining prompts to be more detailed and structured, we increase the likelihood of getting a result that closely matches expectations.
